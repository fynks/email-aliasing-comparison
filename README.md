## What is Email Aliasing?

Email aliasing lets you create alternate email addresses that forward to your real inbox, so you can share unique addresses without exposing your primary email.

Example:
- Real email: john.doe@gmail.com
- Aliases: shopping@provider.com, news@provider.com
- Both forward to your Gmail, and you can often reply from the alias

## How Email Aliasing Works

Think of it like a P.O. Box for your email: you hand out a forwarding address instead of your real one.

Without Aliasing:
- john@gmail.com → used everywhere (easily leaked, spammed)

With Aliasing:
- shopping@alias.com → stores
- social@alias.com → social media
- work@alias.com → professional
- All forward to john@gmail.com

## Types of Email Aliasing

- **Built-in Aliases**: Many email providers offer basic aliasing features like Gmail's `+` addressing (`yourname+tag@gmail.com`) or Outlook's alias system. These are free but have limited management options.

- **Dedicated Services**: Third-party providers specializing in alias management with advanced features like custom domains, encryption, detailed dashboards, and comprehensive privacy controls.


## Benefits and Use Cases

**Privacy & Security**
- Hide your real email from websites and data breaches
- Prevent cross-platform tracking by companies
- Limit damage if one alias gets compromised

**Spam Control**
- Create disposable aliases for one-time signups
- Block spam by deactivating compromised aliases
- Keep your main inbox clean

**Organization**
- Use different aliases for different purposes (work, shopping, social)
- Track which services share or sell your email
- Organize emails by source automatically

A fast path from zero to fully configured—without skipping essentials.

### Step 2: Choose a provider (decision matrix)

| Your Need               | Best Provider         | Price    | Why                           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| Just getting started    | DuckDuckGo 🇺🇸          | Free     | Zero setup, unlimited aliases |
| Basic privacy on budget | Addy.io Lite 🇳🇱        | $1/mo    | Most features per dollar      |
| Max privacy & security  | SimpleLogin 🇨🇭         | $4/mo    | Swiss laws, PGP               |

| Business/Teams          | SimpleLogin Premium 🇨🇭 | $4/mo    | Enterprise-grade              |

### Step 3: Provider setup (condensed, all steps preserved)

#### Option A: DuckDuckGo (best for beginners)
1) Install extension/app: [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bkdgflcldnnnapblkhphbgpggdiikppg) • [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox) • [Mac](https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-duckduckgo-for-mac/)  
2) Visit any signup form → click the duck icon  
3) Alias auto-generates (e.g., duck_xxx@duck.com)  
4) Emails forward to your real inbox  
Pro tip: Generated aliases are permanent—record them and prefer descriptive names when possible.

#### Option B: Addy.io (best value)
1) Sign up: [addy.io](https://addy.io) → verify email  
2) Create first alias in dashboard  
3) Choose format:  
   - Shared domain: random123@addy.io (limited)  
   - Standard: shopping@username.addy.io (unlimited)  
4) Test forwarding (send yourself an email)  
5) Upgrade to Lite ($1/mo) for replies + 1 custom domain  
6) Install extension: [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/addy-io/iadbdpnoknmbdeolbapdackdcogdmjpe) • [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/addy_io/)  
Pro tip: Free plan already includes GPG + API to test advanced flows.

#### Option C: SimpleLogin (most secure)
1) Sign up: [simplelogin.io](https://simplelogin.io) → verify  
2) Create alias (e.g., amazon.purchases@simplelogin.io)  
3) Test forwarding & reply  
4) Install extensions: [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dphilobhebphkdjbpfohgikllaljmgbn) • [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/simplelogin/) • [Safari](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6475835429)  
5) Consider Premium for unlimited aliases + custom domains  
Pro tip: Use descriptive aliases for organization.

#### Option D: Apple Hide My Email (Apple users)
1) Have iCloud+ ($0.99/mo+)  
2) iOS/macOS: Settings → Apple ID → iCloud → Hide My Email  
3) Create alias → use in Safari/Mail/apps  
4) Manage via Settings or iCloud.com

### Step 4: Initial configuration (don’t skip)
- **Secure account:** enable 2FA; set notification prefs
- **Verify function:** send/receive tests; confirm replies; check spam
- **Organize:** pick a naming convention; add aliases to your password manager; set folders/filters; document critical aliases

### Step 5: First Week Action Plan

**Days 1-2: Test & Verify**
- [ ] Create 2-3 test aliases with different names
- [ ] Send test emails to verify forwarding works  
- [ ] Try replying through aliases to confirm functionality
- [ ] Check spam folder for forwarded emails

**Days 3-4: Start Using for New Signups**
- [ ] Use aliases for all new accounts (shopping, newsletters, trials)
- [ ] Keep notes of which alias goes with which service
- [ ] Start with low-risk sites before important accounts
- [ ] Update password manager entries

**Days 5-7: Organize & Optimize**
- [ ] Implement your chosen naming convention
- [ ] Set up email client folders for organization
- [ ] Review and clean up any unused test aliases
- [ ] Plan gradual migration of existing accounts

### Step 6: Migration & scaling

**Phase 1: New Accounts Only (Week 1-2)**
- Use aliases for all new signups
- Don't change existing accounts yet
- Build confidence with the system

**Phase 2: Low-Risk Updates (Week 3-4)**  
- Update newsletter subscriptions
- Change shopping account emails
- Modify social media accounts

**Phase 3: Critical Services (Month 2+)**
- Banking and financial services
- Work-related accounts  
- Two-factor authentication accounts
- Recovery email addresses

#### Scaling Considerations

**When to Upgrade Plans:**
- Free plan limits reached
- Need custom domain for professionalism
- Require advanced features (rules, analytics)
- Business/team use requirements

**Multiple Provider Strategy:**
- Use different providers for different purposes
- Maintain backup provider account
- Distribute risk across services
- Compare features and reliability

# Best Practices

#### Alias Naming Conventions

**Recommended Formats:**
- `service-purpose@provider.com` → `amazon-shopping@provider.com`
- `category-date@provider.com` → `newsletter-2025@provider.com` 
- `trustlevel-service@provider.com` → `trusted-banking@provider.com`

**Avoid:**
- Random strings: `abc123xyz@provider.com` ❌
- Generic names: `general@provider.com` ❌
- Same alias everywhere ❌

#### Organization Strategies

**By Category:**
- `shopping@provider.com` - All e-commerce
- `social@provider.com` - Social media platforms
- `work@provider.com` - Professional accounts  
- `newsletter@provider.com` - Subscriptions

**By Trust Level:**
- `trusted@provider.com` - Banking, important services
- `testing@provider.com` - New services you're trying
- `disposable@provider.com` - One-time signups

**By Time Period:**
- `monthly-2025-01@provider.com` - Rotate monthly
- `yearly-2025@provider.com` - Annual rotation

# Mistakes to Avoid

1) Using random or reused aliases  
- Wrong: abc123xyz@provider.com or general@provider.com  
- Right: amazon.shopping@provider.com (unique per service)

2) Not testing replies  
- Always send a test from your alias before important use

3) Skipping password manager updates  
- Store alias + service mapping to avoid lockouts

4) No backup plan  
- Keep original email active during transition  
- Export aliases and document where used

5) Rushing critical accounts  
- Migrate low-risk accounts first; then banking/work/2FA
